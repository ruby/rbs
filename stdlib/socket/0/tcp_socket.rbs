# TCPSocket represents a TCP/IP client socket.
#
# A simple client may look like:
#
#     require 'socket'
#
#     s = TCPSocket.new 'localhost', 2000
#
#     while line = s.gets # Read lines from socket
#       puts line         # and print them
#     end
#
#     s.close             # close socket when done
#

  #   rdoc-file=ext/socket/tcpsocket.c
  #   - TCPSocket.gethostbyname(hostname) => [official_hostname, alias_hostnames, address_family, *address_list]
  # -->
  # Use Addrinfo.getaddrinfo instead. This method is deprecated for the following
  # reasons:
  #
  # *   The 3rd element of the result is the address family of the first address.
  #     The address families of the rest of the addresses are not returned.
  # *   gethostbyname() may take a long time and it may block other threads. (GVL
  #     cannot be released since gethostbyname() is not thread safe.)
  # *   This method uses gethostbyname() function already removed from POSIX.
  #
  #
  # This method lookups host information by *hostname*.

  #     TCPSocket.gethostbyname("localhost")
