# date and datetime class - Tadayoshi Funaba 1998-2011
#
# 'date' provides two classes: Date and DateTime.
#
# ## Terms and Definitions
#
# Some terms and definitions are based on ISO 8601 and JIS X 0301.
#
# ### Calendar Date
#
# The calendar date is a particular day of a calendar year, identified by its
# ordinal number within a calendar month within that year.
#
# In those classes, this is so-called "civil".
#
# ### Ordinal Date
#
# The ordinal date is a particular day of a calendar year identified by its
# ordinal number within the year.
#
# In those classes, this is so-called "ordinal".
#
# ### Week Date
#
# The week date is a date identified by calendar week and day numbers.
#
# The calendar week is a seven day period within a calendar year, starting on a
# Monday and identified by its ordinal number within the year; the first
# calendar week of the year is the one that includes the first Thursday of that
# year. In the Gregorian calendar, this is equivalent to the week which includes
# January 4.
#
# In those classes, this is so-called "commercial".
#
# ### Julian Day Number
#
# The Julian day number is in elapsed days since noon (Greenwich Mean Time) on
# January 1, 4713 BCE (in the Julian calendar).
#
# In this document, the astronomical Julian day number is the same as the
# original Julian day number. And the chronological Julian day number is a
# variation of the Julian day number. Its days begin at midnight on local time.
#
# In this document, when the term "Julian day number" simply appears, it just
# refers to "chronological Julian day number", not the original.
#
# In those classes, those are so-called "ajd" and "jd".
#
# ### Modified Julian Day Number
#
# The modified Julian day number is in elapsed days since midnight (Coordinated
# Universal Time) on November 17, 1858 CE (in the Gregorian calendar).
#
# In this document, the astronomical modified Julian day number is the same as
# the original modified Julian day number. And the chronological modified Julian
# day number is a variation of the modified Julian day number. Its days begin at
# midnight on local time.
#
# In this document, when the term "modified Julian day number" simply appears,
# it just refers to "chronological modified Julian day number", not the
# original.
#
# In those classes, those are so-called "amjd" and "mjd".
#
# ## Date
#
# A subclass of Object that includes the Comparable module and easily handles
# date.
#
# A Date object is created with Date::new, Date::jd, Date::ordinal,
# Date::commercial, Date::parse, Date::strptime, Date::today, Time#to_date, etc.
#
#     require 'date'
#
#     Date.new(2001,2,3)
#      #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
#     Date.jd(2451944)
#      #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
#     Date.ordinal(2001,34)
#      #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
#     Date.commercial(2001,5,6)
#      #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
#     Date.parse('2001-02-03')
#      #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
#     Date.strptime('03-02-2001', '%d-%m-%Y')
#      #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
#     Time.new(2001,2,3).to_date
#      #=> #<Date: 2001-02-03 ...>
#
# All date objects are immutable; hence cannot modify themselves.
#
# The concept of a date object can be represented as a tuple of the day count,
# the offset and the day of calendar reform.
#
# The day count denotes the absolute position of a temporal dimension. The
# offset is relative adjustment, which determines decoded local time with the
# day count. The day of calendar reform denotes the start day of the new style.
# The old style of the West is the Julian calendar which was adopted by Caesar.
# The new style is the Gregorian calendar, which is the current civil calendar
# of many countries.
#
# The day count is virtually the astronomical Julian day number. The offset in
# this class is usually zero, and cannot be specified directly.
#
# A Date object can be created with an optional argument, the day of calendar
# reform as a Julian day number, which should be 2298874 to 2426355 or
# negative/positive infinity. The default value is `Date::ITALY`
# (2299161=1582-10-15). See also sample/cal.rb.

#
class Date
  # Creates a date object denoting the given calendar date.
  #
  # In this class, BCE years are counted astronomically.  Thus, the year before
  # the year 1 is the year zero, and the year preceding the year zero is the year
  # -1.  The month and the day of month should be a negative or a positive number
  # (as a relative month/day from the end of year/month when negative).  They
  # should not be zero.
  #
  # The last argument should be a Julian day number which denotes the day of
  # calendar reform.  Date::ITALY (2299161=1582-10-15), Date::ENGLAND
  # (2361222=1752-09-14), Date::GREGORIAN (the proleptic Gregorian calendar) and
  # Date::JULIAN (the proleptic Julian calendar) can be specified as a day of
  # calendar reform.

  #
  #     Combination:

  #       %r - 12-hour time (%I:%M:%S %p)
  #       %R - 24-hour time (%H:%M)
  #       %T - 24-hour time (%H:%M:%S)
  #       %+ - date(1) (%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y)
  #
  # This method is similar to the strftime() function defined in ISO C and POSIX.
  # Several directives (%a, %A, %b, %B, %c, %p, %r, %x, %X, %E*, %O* and %Z) are
  # locale dependent in the function. However, this method is locale independent.
  # So, the result may differ even if the same format string is used in other
  # systems such as C. It is good practice to avoid %x and %X because there are
  # corresponding locale independent representations, %D and %T.
