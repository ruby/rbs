# # mutex_m.rb
#
# When 'mutex_m' is required, any object that extends or includes Mutex_m will
# be treated like a Mutex.
#
# Start by requiring the standard library Mutex_m:
#
#     require "mutex_m.rb"
#
# From here you can extend an object with Mutex instance methods:
#
#     obj = Object.new
#     obj.extend Mutex_m
#
# Or mixin Mutex_m into your module to your class inherit Mutex instance methods
# --- remember to call super() in your class initialize method.
#
#     class Foo
#       include Mutex_m
#       def initialize
#         # ...
#         super()
#       end
#       # ...
#     end
#     obj = Foo.new
#     # this obj can be handled like Mutex
#
