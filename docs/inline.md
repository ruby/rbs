# Inline RBS Type Declaration

Inline RBS type declarations allow you to write type annotations directly in your Ruby source files using comments. Instead of maintaining separate `.rbs` files, you can keep your type information alongside your Ruby code, making it easier to keep types and implementation in sync.

The following example defines `Calculator` class and `add` instance method. The `@rbs` comment gives the type of the `add` method with the RBS method type syntax.

```ruby
class Calculator
  # @rbs (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end
```

## Classes

Inline RBS supports class definitions from your Ruby code. When you define a class in Ruby, the library recognizes it and the corresponding class definition is generated in RBS.

```ruby
class App
end
```

The `::App` class is defined in RBS and you can use it as a type.

### Non-constant class paths

Only classes with constant names are imported. Dynamic or non-constant class definitions are ignored:

```ruby
# This class is imported
class MyClass
end

# This is ignored - dynamic class definition
MyClass = Class.new do
end

# This is also ignored - non-constant class name
object = Object
class object::MyClass
end
```

### Class Nesting

Nested classes work as expected:

```ruby
class Client
  class Error
  end
end
```

This creates the types `::Client` and `::Client::Error`.

### Inheritance

Class declarations can have a super class.

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
end
```

The super class specification must be a constant.

The super class specification allows type applications.

```ruby
class StringArray < Array #[String]
end
```

### Current Limitations

- Generic class definitions are not supported

## Modules

Inline RBS supports module definitions from your Ruby code. When you define a module in Ruby, the library recognizes it and the corresponding module definition is generated in RBS.

```ruby
module Helper
end
```

The `::Helper` module is defined in RBS and you can use it as a type.

### Non-constant module paths

Only modules with constant names are imported. Dynamic or non-constant module definitions are ignored:

```ruby
# This module is imported
module MyModule
end

# This is ignored - dynamic module definition
MyModule = Module.new do
end

# This is also ignored - non-constant module name
object = Object
module object::MyModule
end
```

### Module Nesting

Nested modules work as expected:

```ruby
module API
  module V1
    module Resources
    end
  end
end
```

This creates the types `::API`, `::API::V1`, and `::API::V1::Resources`.

### Current Limitations

- Generic module definitions are not supported
- Module self-type constraints are not supported

## Method Definitions

Inline RBS supports methods defined using the `def` syntax in Ruby.

```ruby
class Calculator
  def add(x, y) = x+y
end
```

It detects method definitions and allows you to add annotation comments to describe their types.

### Unannotated method definition

Methods defined with `def` syntax are detected, but they are untyped.

```ruby
class Calculator
  def add(x, y) = x+y
end
```

The type of the `Calculator#add` method is `(?) -> untyped` -- it accepts any arguments without type checking and returns an `untyped` object.

### Method type annotation syntax

You can define the type of the method using `@rbs` and `:` syntax.

```ruby
class Calculator
  # @rbs (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
  def add(x, y) = x + y

  #: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
  def subtract(x, y) = x - y
end
```

The type of both methods is `(Integer, Integer) -> Integer` -- they take two `Integer` objects and return an `Integer` object.

Both syntaxes support method overloading:

```ruby
class Calculator
  # @rbs (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
  #    | (Float, Float) -> Float
  def add(x, y) = x + y

  #: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
  #: (Float, Float) -> Float
  def subtract(x, y) = x - y
end
```

The type of both methods is `(Integer, Integer) -> Integer | (Float, Float) -> Float`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `@rbs METHOD-TYPE` syntax allows overloads with the `|` operator, just like in RBS files.
> Multiple `: METHOD-TYPE` declarations are required for overloads.

#### Doc-style syntax

The `@rbs return: T` syntax declares the return type of a method:

```ruby
class Calculator
  # @rbs return: String
  def to_s
    "Calculator"
  end
end
```

### Current Limitations

- Class methods and singleton methods are not supported
- Parameter types are not supported with doc-style syntax
- Method visibility declaration is not supported yet

## Attributes

Inline RBS supports Ruby's attribute methods: `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor`.

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :name #: String
  attr_writer :age #: Integer
  attr_accessor :email #: String?
end
```

It detects these attribute declarations and generates the corresponding getter and setter methods.

The accessor methods and instance variables are defined.

### Unannotated attributes

Attributes defined without type annotations are treated as `untyped`:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :name
  attr_writer :age
  attr_accessor :email
end
```

### Type annotations for attributes

You can add type annotations to attributes using the `#:` syntax in trailing comments:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :name #: String
  attr_writer :age #: Integer
  attr_accessor :email #: String?
end
```

This generates the following typed methods:
- `name: () -> String`
- `age=: (Integer) -> Integer`
- `email: () -> String?` and `email=: (String?) -> String?`

### Multiple attributes

When declaring multiple attributes in one line, the type annotation applies to all attributes:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :first_name, :last_name #: String
  attr_accessor :age, :height #: Integer
end
```

All attributes in each declaration share the same type.

### Non-symbol attribute names

Attribute names must be symbol literals.

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader "name" #: String

  age = :age
  attr_writer age #: Integer
end
```

The attribute definitions are ignored because the names are given by string literals and local variables.

### Current Limitations

- Attribute visibility is not supported yet. All attributes are _public_

## Mixin

Inline RBS supports Ruby's mixin methods: `include`, `extend`, and `prepend`.

```ruby
module Printable
  # @rbs () -> String
  def to_print
    to_s
  end
end

class Document
  include Printable
  extend Enumerable #[String]
  prepend Trackable
end
```

It detects these mixin declarations and adds them to the class or module definition.

### Basic mixin usage

Mixins work just like in regular RBS files:

```ruby
module Helper
end

class MyClass
  include Helper
  extend Helper
  prepend Helper
end
```

### Type arguments for generic modules

You can specify type arguments for generic modules using the `#[...]` syntax:

```ruby
class TodoList
  include Enumerable #[String]

  # @rbs () { (String) -> void } -> void
  def each(&block)
    @items.each(&block)
  end
end
```

### Module name requirements

Only constant module names are supported. Dynamic module references are not allowed:

```ruby
class MyClass
  include Helper         # ✓ Works - constant name

  mod = Helper
  include mod           # ✗ Ignored - non-constant module reference

  include Helper.new    # ✗ Ignored - not a simple constant
end
```

### Module name resolution

The module name resolution is based on the nesting of the class/module definitions, unlike Ruby.

Modules accessible through ancestors (super-class/included modules) are not supported.

### Current Limitations

- Only single module arguments are supported (no `include A, B` syntax)
- Module names must be constants

## Instance Variables

Inline RBS declaration allows defining instance variables.

```ruby
class Person
  # @rbs @name: String
  # @rbs @age: Integer? --
  #   how old is the person?
  #   `nil` means it's unspecified.

  # @rbs (String name, Integer? age) -> void
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end
```

The `@rbs @VAR-NAME: TYPE` syntax enclosed in `class`/`module` syntax declares instance variables.
You can add the documentation of the variable followed by two hyphones (`--`).

Instance variable declarations must be under the `class`/`module` syntax, and they are ignored if written inside method definitions.

### Current Limitations

- Only instance variables of class/module instances are allowed

## Constants

Constants are supported by inline RBS declaration.

```ruby
Foo = 123

module Bar
  Baz = [1, ""] #: [Integer, String]
end

# Version of the library
#
VERSION = "1.2.3".freeze #: String
```

### Type Inference for Literal Constants

The types of constants may be automatically inferred when the right-hand side consists of literals:

- **Integers**: `COUNT = 42` → `Integer`
- **Floats**: `RATE = 3.14` → `Float`
- **Booleans**: `ENABLED = true` → `bool`
- **Strings**: `NAME = "test"` → `String`
- **Symbols**: `STATUS = :ready` → `:ready`

```ruby
MAX_SIZE = 100           # Inferred as Integer
PI = 3.14159            # Inferred as Float
DEBUG = false           # Inferred as bool
APP_NAME = "MyApp"      # Inferred as String
DEFAULT_MODE = :strict  # Inferred as :strict
```

### Explicit Type Annotations

For more complex types or when you want to override inference, use the `#:` syntax:

```ruby
ITEMS = [1, "hello"] #: [Integer, String]
CONFIG = { name: "app", version: 1 } #: { name: String, version: Integer }
CALLBACK = -> { puts "done" } #: ^() -> void
```

### Documentation Comments

Comments above constant declarations become part of the constant's documentation:

```ruby
# The maximum number of retries allowed
# before giving up on the operation
MAX_RETRIES = 3

# Application configuration loaded from environment
#
# This hash contains all the runtime configuration
# settings for the application.
CONFIG = load_config() #: Hash[String, untyped]
```

## Class/module Aliases

Class and module aliases can be defined by assigning existing classes or modules to constants using the `#: class-alias` or `#: module-alias` syntax.

```ruby
MyObject = Object #: class-alias

MyKernel = Kernel #: module-alias
```

This creates new type names that refer to the same class or module as the original.

The annotations can have optional type name to specify the class/module name, for the case it cannot be infered through the right-hand-side of the constant declaration.

```ruby
MyObject = object #: class-alias Object

MyKernel = kernel #: module-alias Kernel
```

## Visibility

Inline RBS supports `public` and `private` visibilities for methods.

```ruby
class Foo
  private

  # @rbs () -> String
  def hello = "hello"

  public

  # @rbs () -> String
  def world = "world"
end
```

The `hello` method is *private*, and `world` method is *public*.

### Current Limitations

- `public`/`private` calls with arguments are ignored
