class IO
  # <!-- rdoc-file=io_buffer.c -->
  # IO::Buffer is a efficient zero-copy buffer for input/output. There are typical
  # use cases:
  #
  # *   Create an empty buffer with ::new, fill it with buffer using #copy or
  #     #set_value, #set_string, get buffer with #get_string or write it directly
  #     to some file with #write.
  # *   Create a buffer mapped to some string with ::for, then it could be used
  #     both for reading with #get_string or #get_value, and writing (writing will
  #     change the source string, too).
  # *   Create a buffer mapped to some file with ::map, then it could be used for
  #     reading and writing the underlying file.
  # *   Create a string of a fixed size with ::string, then #read into it, or
  #     modify it using #set_value.
  #
  #
  # Interaction with string and file memory is performed by efficient low-level C
  # mechanisms like `memcpy`.
  #
  # The class is meant to be an utility for implementing more high-level
  # mechanisms like Fiber::Scheduler#io_read and Fiber::Scheduler#io_write and
  # parsing binary protocols.
  #
  # ## Examples of Usage
  #
  # Empty buffer:
  #
  #     buffer = IO::Buffer.new(8)  # create empty 8-byte buffer
  #     # =>
  #     # #<IO::Buffer 0x0000555f5d1a5c50+8 INTERNAL>
  #     # ...
  #     buffer
  #     # =>
  #     # <IO::Buffer 0x0000555f5d156ab0+8 INTERNAL>
  #     # 0x00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  #     buffer.set_string('test', 2) # put there bytes of the "test" string, starting from offset 2
  #     # => 4
  #     buffer.get_string  # get the result
  #     # => "\x00\x00test\x00\x00"
  #
  # Buffer from string:
  #
  #     string = 'buffer'
  #     buffer = IO::Buffer.for(string)
  #     # =>
  #     # #<IO::Buffer 0x00007f3f02be9b18+4 SLICE>
  #     # ...
  #     buffer
  #     # =>
  #     # #<IO::Buffer 0x00007f3f02be9b18+4 SLICE>
  #     # 0x00000000  64 61 74 61                                     buffer
  #
  #     buffer.get_string(2)  # read content starting from offset 2
  #     # => "ta"
  #     buffer.set_string('---', 1) # write content, starting from offset 1
  #     # => 3
  #     buffer
  #     # =>
  #     # #<IO::Buffer 0x00007f3f02be9b18+4 SLICE>
  #     # 0x00000000  64 2d 2d 2d                                     d---
  #     string  # original string changed, too
  #     # => "d---"
  #
  # Buffer from file:
  #
  #     File.write('test.txt', 'test buffer')
  #     # => 9
  #     buffer = IO::Buffer.map(File.open('test.txt'))
  #     # =>
  #     # #<IO::Buffer 0x00007f3f0768c000+9 MAPPED IMMUTABLE>
  #     # ...
  #     buffer.get_string(5, 2) # read 2 bytes, starting from offset 5
  #     # => "da"
  #     buffer.set_string('---', 1) # attempt to write
  #     # in `set_string': Buffer is not writable! (IO::Buffer::AccessError)
  #
  #     # To create writable file-mapped buffer
  #     # Open file for read-write, pass size, offset, and flags=0
  #     buffer = IO::Buffer.map(File.open('test.txt', 'r+'), 9, 0, 0)
  #     buffer.set_string('---', 1)
  #     # => 3 -- bytes written
  #     File.read('test.txt')
  #     # => "t--- buffer"
  #
  # **The class is experimental and the interface is subject to change, this is
  # especially true of file mappings which may be removed entirely in the
  # future.**
