    # ARGF is a stream designed for use in scripts that process files given as
    # command-line arguments or passed in via STDIN.
    #
    # The arguments passed to your script are stored in the `ARGV` Array, one
    # argument per element. ARGF assumes that any arguments that aren't filenames
    # have been removed from `ARGV`. For example:
    #
    #     $ ruby argf.rb --verbose file1 file2
    #
    #     ARGV  #=> ["--verbose", "file1", "file2"]
    #     option = ARGV.shift #=> "--verbose"
    #     ARGV  #=> ["file1", "file2"]
    #
    # You can now use ARGF to work with a concatenation of each of these named
    # files. For instance, ARGF.read will return the contents of *file1* followed by
    # the contents of *file2*.
    #
    # After a file in `ARGV` has been read ARGF removes it from the Array. Thus,
    # after all files have been read `ARGV` will be empty.
    #
    # You can manipulate `ARGV` yourself to control what ARGF operates on. If you
    # remove a file from `ARGV`, it is ignored by ARGF; if you add files to `ARGV`,
    # they are treated as if they were named on the command line. For example:
    #
    #     ARGV.replace ["file1"]
    #     ARGF.readlines # Returns the contents of file1 as an Array
    #     ARGV           #=> []
    #     ARGV.replace ["file2", "file3"]
    #     ARGF.read      # Returns the contents of file2 and file3
    #
    # If `ARGV` is empty, ARGF acts as if it contained `"-"` that makes ARGF read
    # from STDIN, i.e. the data piped or typed to your script. For example:
    #
    #     $ echo "glark" | ruby -e 'p ARGF.read'
    #     "glark\n"
    #
    #     $ echo Glark > file1
    #     $ echo "glark" | ruby -e 'p ARGF.read' -- - file1
    #     "glark\nGlark\n"
